I'm a Brazilian Army Officer at the rank of 1st Lieutenant with 8 years (updated Oct 2024) of experience. 

I started at an administrative position and after 5 years i moved to the Lead of IT in my battalion. My journey in military service has honed my skills in communication, leadership, and strategic management, and after moving to the IT Team, i developed a lot of skills in Systems Administration and also software development. 

I am passionate about exploring and maintaining IT systems, solving technical challenges, and contributing to the efficient operation of technological infrastructure. As a proactive professional and lifelong learner.
