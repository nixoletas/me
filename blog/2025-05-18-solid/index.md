## SOLID Principles

SOLID is an acronym for five design principles in object-oriented programming that help make software designs more understandable, flexible, and maintainable.

<!-- truncate -->

### S - Single Responsibility Principle
A class should have only one reason to change, meaning it should have only one job or responsibility.

### O - Open/Closed Principle
Software entities should be open for extension but closed for modification.

### L - Liskov Substitution Principle
Objects of a superclass should be replaceable with objects of its subclasses without breaking the application.

### I - Interface Segregation Principle
A client should not be forced to implement interfaces they don't use.

### D - Dependency Inversion Principle
High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions.

## Why SOLID Matters

Following SOLID principles helps create more maintainable, scalable, and robust software. These principles are fundamental to good object-oriented design and are widely used in modern software development.
